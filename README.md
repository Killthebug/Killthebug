### Hello there 👋

#### I'm Jai, a Machine Learning Engineer by day ☼ and an avid Linguist by night ☾
You'll find me spending a lot of my time tinkering with and reading about applied ML. I've been working on building ML-centric applications for the last 5 years. <br>

#### Professional Experience
I've worked at both early-stage companies (as a founding engineer) and large companies as a research engineer. You can read more about my professional background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaipaleth/).

1. AI for Document Information Extraction
2. Context-based Recommendation Systems
3. Active Learning Pipelines
4. Medical Document QA Systems
5. MLOps Architecture and more

#### How did I get here?
Before my professional career, I was a part of the [Language Technology Research Centre](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/) where I published my thesis on cross lingual transfer learning.
You can read more about my research at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=tgP-3f0AAAAJ&hl=en)
